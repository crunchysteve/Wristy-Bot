## METAL HARDWARE

``` Text
MATERIALS
(My materials are sourced from my local hardware and the actuators and bearings I sourced from eBay,
you may need to alter the design slightly. I also machined my own spacers and threaded them for M3 screws.)

2x 1m lengths of 60x3 aluminium flatbar will build 10 (2x sides)
1x 1m length of 40x20x2   "     square tube will build 10 (rocker)
1x 1m length of 10mm      "     round bar (will build enough spacers)

      WORKING
        -   centre drill 3mm hole with lathe for all spacers
            cut 2 to 30mm lengths
            cut 2 to 4mm lengths after lathing outer to 5mm
      (...or use off the shelf spacers

1x 1m length of 40x12x1.6 aluminium angle will easily build brackets for 10 units.
1x car door linear actuator
2x MF83-2Z bearing 8mm OD x 3mm ID x 3mm Wide

Assorted M3 screws and nuts, including...
  M3x 40mm if spacers are unthreaded or M3x 8mm if the spacers are threaded.
Nuts, washers and other hardware as needed.
